- wordstone block (with block entity)
	- placing prompts you to enter a unique 4 letter combo
	- right clicking allows you to write any 4 letter combo and teleport to it if it exists
	- teleporting drops most (maybe all?) your items on the ground
- drop box block (with block entity)
	- stores an inventory for each player that opens it
	- players can take out items but not put them in
	- when placed next to a wordstone, all dropped items go in the drop box instead
- last will item
	- can be assigned to a drop box
	- after you die and some other condition applies, it sends your items to the dropbox instead of dropping them
